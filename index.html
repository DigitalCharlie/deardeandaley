            Tell USC: Remove Bryan Singer’s name from the School of Cinematic Arts
        </h1>
        
        <p>
            It is unacceptable that the USC School of Cinematic Arts has named one of its departments after Bryan Singer, a man accused multiple times of sexual harassment, assault, and pedophilia. In light of the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault revelations and the cascade of accountability since, we have a real chance to rename a department that  never should have been named for Bryan Singer in the first place.

            Here's the longer version of what's going on:
        </p>

        <p>
            As students of the USC School of Cinematic Arts, we implore Dean Elizabeth Daley and the appropriate administration to change the name of the Bryan Singer Division of Cinema & Media Studies to simply the SCA Division of Cinema & Media Studies. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The CAMS department has been named after Mr. Singer since 2013, following a $5M contribution to the university. However, as students committed to creating an environment of respect, we are uncomfortable with allowing Mr. Singer’s name to remain in public association with our university, and are asking the administration to take a stand against sexual violence and the culture of abuse that permeate Hollywood and remove the name. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We are asking for help from students, alumni, and the community at large in order to catalyze this change. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We first launched this petition two weeks ago, and already almost 4,000 people have signed our petition calling on SCA to change the name of the department. We met with the Dean earlier this week, and they have said without a louder outcry, they will not change the name. So the next step is making sure than in addition to hearing from us as a group, they hear from us as individuals — and that means flooding the Dean's inbox with our feelings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please join us make your voice heard by emailing the administration on behalf of the movement. We’ve set up some sample text to simplify things, but if you feel inspired or have a personal message, please feel free to modify the text to make it your own. 
        </p>
